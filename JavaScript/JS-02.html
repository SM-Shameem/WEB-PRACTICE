syntax
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# javascript syntax is the rules, how javascript programs are constructed 

# javascript values - 
- the javascript soyntax defines two types of values : fixed-values and variable-values 
- fixed-values are called literals 
- variable-values are called variables 

# javascript literals - 
- the two most important syntax rules for fixed values are : numbers and strings
- numbers are written with or without decimals 
- strings are text, written within double or single quotes 

# javascript variables - 
- in a programming language, variables are used to store data values 
- javascript uses the (var) keyword to declare variables 
- an equal sign is used to assign values to variables 

# javascript operators - 
- javascript uses arithmetic operators to compute values, like (+, -, *, /)
- javascript uses an assignment operator to assign values to variables, like (=)

# javascript expressions - 
- an expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value 
- the computation is called an evaluation 
- expressions can also contain variable values 
- the values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings 

# javascript keywords - 
- javascript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed
  like, the (var) keyword tells the browser to create variables 
  
# javascript comment - 
- not all javascript statements are executed 
- code after double slashes (//) or between (/* and */) is treated as a comment 
- comments are ignored, and will not be executed 

# javascript identifiers 
- identifiers are names 
- in javascript, identifiers are used to name variables (and keywords, and functions, and labels) 
- the rules for legal names are much the same in most programming languages 
- in javascript, the first character must be a letter, or an underscore(_), or a dollar sign ($)
- subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs 
- number are not allowed as the first character. 
  this way javascript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers 
  
# javascript is case-sensitive 
- all javascript identifiers are case-sensitive 
- javascript does not interpret (VAR or Var) as the keyword (var) 

# javascript anc camel case 
- historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name 
- hyphens are not allowed in javascript, they are reserved for subtractions 
- using (underscore), like, (firs_name, last_name) 
- using (upper camel case/pascal case), like, (FirstName, LastName)
- using (loser camel case), like, (firstName, lastName)
  javascript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter 
  
# javascript character set 
- javascript uses the (unicode) character set 
- unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
statements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# javascript programs 
- a computer program is a list of instructions to be executed by a computer 
- in a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements 
- a javascript program is a list of programming statemetns 
- note : in HTML, javascript programs are executed by the web browser 

# javascript statements 
- javascript statements are composed of (values, operators, expressions, keywords, and comments)
- most javascript programs contain many javascript statements 
- the statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written 
- javascript programs and javascript statements are often called javascript code 

# semicolons 
- semicolons separate javascript statements 
- add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement 
- when separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed 
- note on the web, you might see examples without semicolons, 
  ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended
  
# javascript white space 
- javascript ignores multiple spaces, you can add white space to your script to make it more readable 
- a good practice is to put spaces around operators 

# javascript line length and line breaks 
- for best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters 
- if a javascript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator - 

# javascript code blocks ]
- javascript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets { ... }
- the purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together 
  one place yo will find statement grouped together in blocks, is in javascript functions - 
- note : in this tutorial we use 2 spaces of indentation for code blocks 

# javascript keywords - 
- javascript statements often start with a (keyword) to identify the javascript action to be performed 
- javascript keywords are reserved words, and reserved words cannot be used as names for identifiers 
- here is a list of some of te keywords you will learn about - 
  01. break (terminates a switch or a loop) 
  02. continue (jumps out of a loop and starts at the top)
  03. debugger (stops the execution of javascript, and calls - if available - the debugging function)
  04. do-while (executes a block of statements, and repeats the block, while a condition is true)
  05. for (marks a block of statements to be executed, as long as a condition is true)
  06. function (declares a function)
  07. if-else (marks a block of statements to be executed, depending on a condition)
  08. return (exits a function) 
  09. switch (marks a block of statements to be executed, depending on different cases)
  10. try-catch (implements error handling to a block of statements)
  11. var (declares a variable)

comments
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# javascript comments can be used to explain javascript code, and to make it more readable 
# javascript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code 

# single-line comment - 
- single line comments start with (//) 
- any text between (//) and the end of the line will be ignored by javascript (will not be executed) 
- single-line comment can be use before or at the end of each statement to explain the code 

# multi-line comment - 
- multi-line comments start with (/*) and end with (*/) 
- any text between (/* and */) will be ignored by javascript
- multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code 
- it is most common to use single line comments, block comments are often used for formal documentation 

# using comments to prevent execution 
- using comments to prevent execution of code is suitable for code testing 
- adding (//) in front of a code line changes the code lines from an executable line to a comment 
- multi-line comment block can use to prevent execution of multiple code lines

Reserved words
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# javascript reserved words
- in javascript you cannot use these reserved words as variables, labels, or function names
- words marked with (*) are new in ECMAScript 5 and 6 
  > abstract      > arguments      > await*      
  > boolean       > break          > byte
  > case          > catch          > char      > class*      > const       > continue
