javascript (object) fundamental
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# real life objects, properties, and methods 
- in real life, a car is an object 
- a car has (properties) like (weight and color), and (methods) like (start and stop) 
- all cars have the same (properties), but the (property values) differ from car to car 
- all cars have the same (methods), but the (methods) are performed at different times 

# javascript objects 
- yo have already learned that javascript variables are containers for data values 
- this code assigns a (simple value) (Fiat) to a (variable) named car 
  like > var car = "Fiat";
- objects are variables too, but objects can contain many values 
- this code assigns (many values (Fiat, 500, white) to a (variable) named car 
  like > var car = {type: "Fiat", model:"500", color: "white"}; 
- the values are written as (name:value) pairs (name and value separated by a colon) 
- javascript objects are containers for (named values) called (properties or methods)

# object definition 
- you define (and create) a javascript object with an object literal - 
  like > var person = {forstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", age: 50, eyeColor: "blue"}; 
- spaces and line breaks are not important, an object definition can span multiple lines 
  like > var person = { 
  firstName: "john", 
  lastName: "doe", 
  age: 50, 
  eyeColor: "blue"
  };
	
# object properties 
- the (name:values) pairs in javascript objects are called (properites) 

# accessing object properites 
- you can access object (properties) in two ways 
  > objectName.propertryName 
	like > person.lastName; 
  > objectName["propertyName"]
	like > person["lastName"];
	
# object methods 
- objects can also have (methods) 
- methods are (actions) that can be performed on objects 
- methods are stored in (properties) as (function definitions) 
  like > 
  var person { 
  firstName: "john",
	lastName: "doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue",
  funllName: function() { return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName; } 
  };
- a method is a functio stored as a property 

# the (this) keyword 
- in a functio ndefinition, (this) refers to the (owner) of the function 
- in the ecample above, (this) is the (person object) that (owns) the (fullName) function 
- in other words, (this.firstName) means the (firstName) property of (this object) 

# accessing object methods 
- you access an object (method) with th efollowing syntax 
  > objectName.methodName() 
	like > name = person.fullName(); 
- if you access a method without the () parentheses, it will return the (function definition) 
  like > name = person.fullName;
	
# do not declare (strings, numbers, and booleans) as objects 
- when a javascript variable is declared with the keyword (new), the variable is created as an object 
  like > var x = new String(); // declares (x) as a string-object 
  like > var y = new Number(); // declares (y) as a number-object 
  like > var z = new Boolean(); // declares (z) as a boolean-object 
- avoid (string, number, and boolean) objects. they complicate your code and slow down execution speed

javascript (this) keyword 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# example - 
  var person = { 
  firstName: "john", lastName: "Doe", id: 5566, 
  fullName: function() { return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName; } 
  };
	
# what is (this) 
- the javascript (this) keyword refers to the object it belongs to 
- note > it has different values depending on where it is used 
  > in a method, (this) refers to the (owner object) 
  > alone, (this) referes to the (global object) 
  > in a function, (this) refers to th e(global object) 
  > in a function, in (strict) mode, (this) is (undefined) 
  > in an event, (this) referes to the element that received tha event 
  > methods like (call()), and (apply()) can refer (this) to (any object) 
	
# (this) in a method 
- in an object method, (this) refers to the (owner) of th emethod 
- in the example on the top of this page, (this) refers to the (person) object 
- the (person) object is the (owner) of the (fulName) method 
  like > fullName: function() { return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName; } 
	
# (this) alone 
- when used alone, the (owner) is the (global) object, so (this) refers to the global object 
- in a browser window the (global) object is [object Window] - 
  like > var x = this; 
- in (strict) mode, when used alone, (this) also refers to the (global) object [object Window] - 
  like > "use strict"; var x = this; 
	
# (this) in a function (default) 
- in a javascript function, the owner of the function is the (default) binding for (this) 
- so, in a function, (this) refers to the (global) object [object Window]
  like > function funcOne() { return this; } 
	
# (this) in a function (strict) 
- javascript (strict) mode does not allow default binding 
- so, when used in a function, in (strict) mode, (this) is (undefined) 
  like > "use strict"; function funcOne() { return this; } 
	
# (this) in event handlers 
- in html event handlers, (this) refers to the html element that received the event 
  like > < button onclick="this.style.display='none'" > click to remove me </ button > 
	
# object method binding 
- in these examples, (this) is the (person) object (the person object is the (owner) of the function) 
  like > var person = { 
  firstName: "John", lastName: "Deo", id: 5566, 
  funcOne: function() { return this; } 
  };
	
	like > var person = { 
  firstName: "John", lastName: "Deo", id: 5566, 
  funcOne: function() { return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName; } 
  };
	
- in other words: (this.firstName) means the (firstName) property of (this) (person) object 

# explicit function binding 
- the (call()) and (apply()) methods are predefined javascript methods 
- they can both be used to call an object method with another object as argument 
- in the example below, when callign (person1.fullName) with (person2) as argument, (this) will refer to (person2),
  even if it is a method of (person1) - 
	live > var person1 = {
