# javascript objects 
- in javascript, objects are king. if you understand objects, you understand javascript 
- in javascript, almost everything is an object 
  > booleans can be objects (if defined with the (new) keyword) 
  > numbers can be objects (if defined with the (new) keyword) 
  > strings can be objects (if defined with the (new) keyword) 
  > dates are always objects 
  > maths are always objects 
  > regular expressions are always objects 
  > arrays are always objects
  > functions are always objects 
  > objects are always objects 
- all javascript values, except primitives, are objects 

# javascript primitives 
- a (primitive value) is a value that has no properties or methods 
- a (primitive data type) is data that has a primitive values
- javascript defines 5 types of primitive data types (string | number | boolean | null | undefined) 
- primitive values are immutable (they are hard-coded and therefore cannot be changed) 
- note > if x = 3.14, you can change the value of (x). but you cannot change the value of 3.14 
  > "hello" (is always string)
  > 3.14 (is always number)
  > true (is always true as boolean)
  > null (is always null/object)
  > undefined (is always undefined)
  
# objects are variables 
- javascript variables can contain single values, like > var person = "john doe";
- objects are variables too. but objects can contain many values 
- the values are written as (name:value) pairs (name and value separated by a colon)
  like > var person = { firstName:"john", lastName:"doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue" };
- note > a javascript objects is a collection of (named values) 

# object properties 
- the named values, in javascript objects, are called (properties) 
  > firstName (property) > "john" (value)
  > age (property)       > 50 (value)
  > eyeColor (properyt)  > "blue" (value)
- objects written as (name:value) pairs are similar to 
  > associative arrays in PHP 
  > dictionaries in Python 
  > hash tables in C
  > hash maps in java 
  > hashes in ruby and perl 
  
# object methods 
- methods are (actions) that can be performed on objects 
- object properties can be both (primitive values, other objects, and functions)
- an (object method) is an object property containing a (function definition)
  > firstName (property) > "john" (value)"
  > age (propery)        > 50 (value)
  > cycColor (property)  > "blue" (value)
  > fullName (property)  > function() { return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName; } (value) 
- note > javascript object are containers for named values, called (properties and methods)

# creating a javascript object 
- with javascript, you can define and create your own objects 
- there are different ways to create new objects 
  > define and create a single object, using an object literal 
  > define and create a single object, with the keyword (new) 
  > define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type 
- note > in ECMAScript 5, an object can also be created with the function (Object.create()) 

# using an object literal 
- this is the easiest way to create a javascript object 
- using an object literal, you both define and create an object in one statement 
- an object literal is a list of (name:value) pairs (like, age:5) inside curly braces {} 
- the following example creates a new javascript object with four properties 
  like > var person = { firstName: "john", lastName: "doe", age: 50, eyeColor: "blue" }
- spaces and line breaks are not important. an object definition can span multiple lines 
  like > var person = { 
    firstName: "john",
    lastName: "doe",
    age: 50, 
    eyeColor: "blue"
  };
  
# using the javascript keyword (new)
- the following example also creates a new javascript object with four properties - 
  like > var person = new Object(); 
  person.firstName = "john";
  person.lastName = "doe";
  person.age = 50;
  person.eyeColor = "blue"; 
- note > the two examples above do exactly the same. thre is no need to use (new Object())
  for simplicity, readability and execution speed, use the first one (the object literal method) 
  
# javascript objects are (mutable) 
- objects are mutable: they are addressed by reference, not by value 
- if person is an object, the following statement will not create a copy of person 
  like > var x = person; // this will not create a copy of person 
- the object (x) is (not a copy) of person. it is person. both (x) and (person) are the same (object) 
- any changes to (x) will also change (person), because (x) and (person) are the same (object) 
  like > var person = { firstName: "john", lastName: "doe", age: 50, eyeColor: "blue" }
  var x = person;
  x.age = 10; // this will change both (x.age) and (person.age)
