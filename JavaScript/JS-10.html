function fundamental
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# a javascript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task 
# a javascript function is executed when something invokes it (calls it) 
  like > function funcOne(P1, P2) { return P1 * P2; // the function returns (P1 x P2) } 
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = funcOne(2, 4);
	
# function syntax 
- a javascript function is defined with the (function) keyword, followed by a (functionName), 
  followed by parentheses() 
- function (names) can contain (letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables) 
- the (parentheses) may or may not include (parameters) separated by commas, like (paraOne, paraTwo, ... paraN);
- the code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets { .. }, just after the (parenthese) 
  like > function funcName(paraOne, paraTwo, paraN) { // code to be executed } 
	
- function (parameters) are listed inside the (parentheses) in the function definition 
- function (arguments) are the (values) received by the function when it is invoked 
- inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables 
- note > a function is much the same as a procedure or a subroutine, in other programming languages 

# function invocation 
- the code inside the function will execute when someting invodes (calls) the function 
  > when an event occurs (when a user clicks a button) 
  > when it is invoked (called) from javascript code 
  > automatically (self invoked) 
	
# function return 
- when javascript reaches a (return) statement, the function will stop executing 
- if the function was invoked from a statemetn, javascript will return to execute the code after the invoking 
- functions often compute a (return value). the (return value) is returned back to the caller 
- example, calculate the product of two numbers, and return the result 
  var x = funcOne(2,4); // function is called, return value will end up in (x) 
  function funcOne(a, b) { return a*b; // function returns the product of (a) and (b) } 
	
# why function 
- you can resue code: define the code once, and use it many times 
- you can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results 
- convert fahrenheit to celsius 
  function toCelsius(fahrenheit) { return (5/9) * (fahrenheit-32); } 
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = toCelsius(77);
	
# the () operator invokes the function 
- example above, (toCelsius) referes to the funciton object, and (teCelsius()) referes to the function result 
- accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result 
- example above 
  
# function used as variable values 
- functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations
- example, instead of using a variable to store the return value of a function 
  var x = toCelsius(77);
  var text = "the temperature is " + x + " celsius";
- example, you can use the function directly, as a variable value 
  var text = "the temerature is " + teCelsius(77) + " celsius";
	
# local variables 
- variables declared within a javascript function, become (local) to the function 
- local variable can only be accessed from within the function 
- example 
  // code here can not use (carName) 
  function funcOne() { var carName = "volvo"; // code here can use (carName) } 
	// code here can not use (carName) 
- since (local) variables are only recognized inside there functions, variables with the same name can be used in 
  different function 
- local variables are create when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed

javascript (arrow) function 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# arrow functions were introduced in ES6 
# arrow function allows us to write shorter function syntax - 
  like > hello = function() { return "hello world!"; } 
- with arrow function 
  like > hello = () => { return "hello world"; } 
- it gets shorter! if the function has only one statement, and the statement returns a value, 
  you can remove the brackets and the (return) keyword 
  like > hello = () => "hello world!"; 
- note > this works only if the function has only one statemetn 
- if you have parameters, you pass them inside the parentheses - 
  like > hello = (val) => "hello " + val; 
- in fact, if you have only one parameter, you can skip the parentheses as well 
- arrow function without parentheses 
  like > hello = val => "hello " + val; 
	
# what about (this) 
- the handling of (this) is also different in arrow functions compared to regular functions 
- in short, with arrow functions there are no binding of (this) 
- in regular functions the (this) keyword represented the object that called the function, 
  which could be the window, the document, a button or whatever 
- with arrow functions the (this) keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function 
- let us take a look at two examples to understand the difference 
- both examples call a method twice, first when the page loads, and once again when the user clicks a button 
- the first example uses a regular function, and the second example uses an arrow function 
- the result shows that the first example returns two different objects (window and button), 
  and the second example returns the window object twice, because the window object is the owner of the function 
	
- with a (regular) function (this) represents the object that calls the function 
  like > // regular function 
  hello = function() { document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += this; } 
  // the window object calls the function 
  window.addEventListener("load", hello); 
  // a button object calls the function 
  document.getElementById("but").addEventListener("click", hellow);
	
- with an (arrow) function (this) represents the owner of the function 
  like > // arrow function 
  hello = () => { doucment.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += this; } 
  // the window object calls the function 
  window.addEventListener("load", hello); 
  // a button object calls the function 
  document.getElementById("but").addEventListener("click", hello);
	
- remember these differences when you are working with functions. 
  sometimes the behaior of regular functions is what you want, if not, use arrow functions 
	
# browser support 
- the following table defines the first browser versions with full support for (arrow) functions in javascript
  chrome 45 | opera 32 | edge 12 (2015), safari 10 (2016), firefox 22 (2013)

javascript event
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# HTML events are things that happen to HTML elements 
# when javascript is used in HTML pages, javascript can react on these events 
# HTML events 
- an HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does 
- here are some examples of HTML events - 
  > an HTML web page has finished loading 
  > an HTML input field was changed 
  > an HTML button was clicked 
- often, when events happen, you may want to do someting 
- javascript lets you execute code when events are detected 
- HTML allows event handler attributes, (with javascript code), to be added to HTML elements 
- with single quotes, like < element event='some javascript' > 
- with double quotes, like < element event="some javascript" > 
- in the following example an (onclick) attribute (with code), is added to a < button > element 
  like > < button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()" > time </ button > 
- in the example above, the javascript code changes the content of the element with (id="demo")
- in the next example, the code changes the content of its own element (using this.innerHTML) 
  like > < button onclick="this.innerHTML = Date()" > time </ button > 
- note > javascript code is often several lines long. it is more common to see event attributes calling functions 
  like > < button onclick="displayDate()"> time </ button >
	
# common HTML events 
- here is a list of some common HTML events - 
  1. onchange (an HTML element has been changed) 
  2. onclick (the user clicks an HTML element) 
  3. onmouseover (the user moves the mouse over an HTML element) 
  4. onmouseout (the user moves the mouse away from an HTML element) 
  5. onkeydown (the user pushes a keyw=board key) 
  6. onload (the browser has finished loading the page) 
- follow javascript reference HTML-DOM events 

# what can javascript do 
- event handlers can be used to handle and verify user input, user actions, and browser actions - 
  > things that should be done every timne page loads 
  > things that should be done when the page is closed 
  > action that should be performed when a user clicks a button 
  > content that should be verified when a user inputs data 
  > and more -- 
- many, different methods can be used to let javascript work with events - 
  > HTML event attributes can execute javascript code directly 
  > HTML event attributes can call javascript functions 
  > you can assign your own event handler functions to HTML elements 
  > you can prevent events from beign sent or being handled 
  > and more ..
