# in this tutorial, learning speed is your choice 
  everything is up to you 
	if you are struggling, take a break, or re-read the material 
- always make sure you understand all the examples 
- the only way to become a clever programmer is to - practice and code more and more 
# W3Schools maintains a complete javascript reference, including all (HTML and Browser) objects 
- the reference contains examples for all (properties, methods, and events) 
- the reference is continuously updated according to the latest web standards

what javascript can do 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# javascript can change html content 
- one of many javascript html methods is (getElementById())
- we can finds an html element with (id) attribute value as the parameter of (getElementById()) method 
- then can changes the element contnet by (innerHTML) property 
- javascript accepts both double and singel quotes 
- example > document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 'Hello JavaScript';

# javascript can change html attribute values 
- like, the (src) attribute value of (img) tags 
- example > document.getElementById("demo").src="image.gif"

# javascript can change html styles or css 
- changing the style of an HTML element, is a variant of changing an HTML attribute 
- example > document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "35px";

# javascript can hide/show html element 
- showing/hiding HTML elements can be done by changing the (display) property value of css 
= example > document.getElementById('demo').style.display = "block|none"

about javascript 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# javascript and java are completely different lnaguages, both in concept and design 
# javascript was invented by brendan eich in 1995, and become an ECMA standard in 1997
# ECMA-262 is the official name of ht estandard, ECMAScript is the official name of the lnaguage

the (script) tag 	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# in HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between (script) and (/script) tags 
- older javascript examples may use a type attribute (script type="text/javascript")
- the (type) attribute is not required, javascript is the default scripting language in HTML 
# example - 
  < script > 
	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "javascript output" 
	< / script > 
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
javascript functions and events 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# a javascript (function) is a block of javascript code, that can be executed when called for 
- a javascript function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
javascript in (head/body) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# you can place any number of scripts in an HTML document 
# scripts can be placed in the (body) or in the (head) section of an HTML page, or in both 
# placing scripts at the bottom of the (body) element improves the display speed, because script 
  interpretation slows down the display
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
external javascript 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# scripts can also be placed in external files 
- external scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages 
- javascript files have the file extension (.js) 
- to use an external script, put the name of the script file in the (src) attribute of a (script) tag
# you can place an external script reference in (head) or (body) as you like 
- the script will behave as if it was located exactly where the (script) tag is located 
# externla scripts cannot contain (script) tags 

# externla javascript advantages - 
# placing scripts in externla files has some advantages 
- it separates HTML and code 
- it makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain 
- cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads 
# to add several script files to one page - use several (script) tags 

# external references - 
- external scripts can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page 
- external script (url) reference (script src="url")
- external script (located in a specified folder on the current web site) reference (script src="/js/script.js")
- external script (located in the same folder as the current page) reference (script src="script.js")

javascript output 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# javascript can display data in different ways - 
- writing into an HTML element, using (innerHTML) 
- writing into the HTML ouput using (document.write())
- writing into an alert box, using (window.alert())
- writing into the browser console, using (console.log())

# javascript does not have any print object or print methods 
- you cannot access output devices from javascript 
- the only exception is that you can call the (window.print()) method in the browser to print the content 
  of the current window 
- like : < button onclick="window.print()">print this page</ button >

# using innerHTML 
- to access an HTML element, javascript can use the (document.getElementById(id)) method 
- to (id) attribute defines the HTML element, the (innerHTML) property defines the HTML content 
- note - changing the (innerHTML) property of an HTML element is a common way to display data in HTML 

# using document.write() 
- for testing purposes, it is convenient to use (document.write())
- like : < script > document.write(5 + 6); </ script >
- using (document.write()) after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML 

# using window.alert() 
- you can use an (alert box) to display data 
- like : < script > window.alert(5 + 6); </ script >

- you can skip the (window) keyword
- in javascript, the (window) object is the global scope object, that means that variables, properties, and 
  methods by default belong to window object. this also means that specifying (window) keyword is optional
- like : < script > alert(5 + 6); </ script >

# using console.log() 
- for debugging purposes, you can call the (console.log()) method in the browser to display data 
- like : < script > console.log(5 + 6); </ script >
