# JSON : JavaScript Object Notation 
# JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data 
# JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation 

# exchanging data 
- when exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text 
- JSON is text, and we can convert any javascript object into JSON, and send JSON to the server 
- we can also convert any JSON received from the server into javascript objects 
- this way we can work with the data as javascript objects, with no complicated parsing and translations 

# sending data 
- if you have data stored in a javascript object, you can convert the object into JSON, and send it to a server 
  like > 
  var myObj = {name: "John", age: 31, city: "New York"};
  var myJSON = JSON.stringify(myObj);
  window.location = "demo_json.php?x=" + myJSON;
- you will learn more about the (JSON.stringify()) function later 

# receiving data 
- if you receive data in JSON format, you can convert it into a javascript object 
  like > 
  var myJSON = '{"name":"John", "age":31, "city":"New York"}';
  var myObj = JSON.parse(myJSON);
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myObj.name; 
- you will learn more about the (JSON.parse()) function later 

# storing data 
- when storing data, the data has to be a certain format, and regardless of where you choose to store it, 
  text is always one of the legal formats 
- JSON makes it possible to store javascript objects as text 
- storing data in local storage 
  like > 	
  // Storing data:
  myObj = {name: "John", age: 31, city: "New York"};
  myJSON = JSON.stringify(myObj);
  localStorage.setItem("testJSON", myJSON);

  // Retrieving data:
  text = localStorage.getItem("testJSON");
  obj = JSON.parse(text);
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = obj.name; 
  
# what is JSON 
- JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation 
- JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format 
- JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand 
- JSON is language independent* 
- note > * JSON use javascript syntax, but the JSON format is text only. 
  text can be read and used as a data format by any programming language 
- note > the JSON format was originally specified by (Douglas Crockford)

# why use JSON 
- since the JSON format is text only, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and used as a data format 
  by any programming language 
- javascript has a built in function to convert a string like (JSON format), into native javascript objects 
  like > JSON.parse() 
- so, if you receive data from a server, in JSON format, you can use it like any other javascript object

syntax 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# the JSON syntax is a subset of the javascript syntax 

# JSON syntax rules 
- JSON syntax is derived form javascript object notation syntax 
  > data is in (name/value) pairs 
  > data is separated by commas 
  > curly braces hold objects 
  > square brackets hold arrays 
  
# JSON data - a Name and a Value 
- JSON data is written as (name/value) pairs 
- a (name/value) pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value - 
  like > "name":"john"
- note > JSON names require double quotes. javascript names don't

# JSON - evaluates to javascript objects 
-
