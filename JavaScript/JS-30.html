# JSON : JavaScript Object Notation 
# JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data 
# JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation 

# exchanging data 
- when exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text 
- JSON is text, and we can convert any javascript object into JSON, and send JSON to the server 
- we can also convert any JSON received from the server into javascript objects 
- this way we can work with the data as javascript objects, with no complicated parsing and translations 

# sending data 
- if you have data stored in a javascript object, you can convert the object into JSON, and send it to a server 
  like > 
  var myObj = {name: "John", age: 31, city: "New York"};
  var myJSON = JSON.stringify(myObj);
  window.location = "demo_json.php?x=" + myJSON;
- you will learn more about the (JSON.stringify()) function later 

# receiving data 
- if you receive data in JSON format, you can convert it into a javascript object 
  like > 
  var myJSON = '{"name":"John", "age":31, "city":"New York"}';
  var myObj = JSON.parse(myJSON);
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myObj.name; 
- you will learn more about the (JSON.parse()) function later 

# storing data 
- when storing data, the data has to be a certain format, and regardless of where you choose to store it, 
  text is always one of the legal formats 
- JSON makes it possible to store javascript objects as text 
- storing data in local storage 
  like > 	
  // Storing data:
  myObj = {name: "John", age: 31, city: "New York"};
  myJSON = JSON.stringify(myObj);
  localStorage.setItem("testJSON", myJSON);

  // Retrieving data:
  text = localStorage.getItem("testJSON");
  obj = JSON.parse(text);
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = obj.name; 
  
# what is JSON 
- JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation 
- JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format 
- JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand 
- JSON is language independent* 
- note > * JSON use javascript syntax, but the JSON format is text only. 
  text can be read and used as a data format by any programming language 
- note > the JSON format was originally specified by (Douglas Crockford)

# why use JSON 
- since the JSON format is text only, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and used as a data format 
  by any programming language 
- javascript has a built in function to convert a string like (JSON format), into native javascript objects 
  like > JSON.parse() 
- so, if you receive data from a server, in JSON format, you can use it like any other javascript object

syntax 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# the JSON syntax is a subset of the javascript syntax 

# JSON syntax rules 
- JSON syntax is derived form javascript object notation syntax 
  > data is in (name/value) pairs 
  > data is separated by commas 
  > curly braces hold objects 
  > square brackets hold arrays 
  
# JSON data - a Name and a Value 
- JSON data is written as (name/value) pairs 
- a (name/value) pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value - 
  like > "name":"john"
- note > JSON names require double quotes. javascript names don't

# JSON - evaluates to javascript objects 
- the JSON format is almost identical to javascript objects 
- in JSON, keys must be strings, written with double quotes 
  like > { "name":"john" }
- in javascript, keys can be strings, numbers, or identifier names -
  like > { name: "john" }
  
# JSON values 
- in JSON, values must be one of the following data types 
  1. a string 
  2. a number 
  3. an object (JSON object)
  4. an array 
  5. a boolean 
  6. null 
- in javascript values can be all of the above, plus any other valid javascript expression, including 
  > a function 
  > a date 
  > undefined 
- in JSON, string values must be written with double quotes 
  like > { "name":"john" }
- in javascript, you can write string values with double or single quotes 
  like > { name: 'john' }
  
# JSON uses javascript syntax 
- because JSON syntax is derived from javascript object notation, very little extra software is needed to work 
  with JSON within javascript 
- with javascript you can create an object and assign data to it, like this
  like > var person = { name: "john", age: 31, city: "new youk" } 
- you can access a javascript object like this, like > person.name; // returns john
- it can also be accessed like this, like > person["name"]; // returns john 
- data can be modified like this, like > person.name = "gilbert";
- it can also be modified like this, like > person["name"] = "gilbert";
- note > you will learn how to convert javascript objects into JSON later 

# javascript arrays as JSON 
- the same way javascript objects can be used as JSON, javascript arrays can also be used as JSON 
- you will learn more about arrays as JSON later in this tutorial 

# JSON files 
  > the file type for JSON files is (.json)
  > the MIME type for JSON text is (application/json)

JSON vs XML
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# both JSON and XML can be used to receive data from a web server 
# the following JSON and XML examples both define an employees object, with an array of 3 employees 
- JSON example >   
  {"employees":[
  { "firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe" },
  { "firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith" },
  { "firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones" }
  ]}
- XML example > 
  < employees >
    < employee > < firstName >John< /firstName > < lastName >Doe< /lastName > < /employee >
    < employee > < firstName >Anna< /firstName > < lastName >Smith< /lastName > < /employee >
    < employee > < firstName >Peter< /firstName > < lastName >Jones< /lastName > < /employee >
  < /employees >
  
# JSON is like XML because 
  > both JSON and XML are (self describing and human readable) 
  > both JSON and XML are hierarchical (values within values) 
  > both JSON and XML can be parsed and used by lots of programming languages 
  > both JSON and XML can be fetched with an (XMLHttpRequest) 
  
# JSON is unlike XML because 
  > JSON doesn't use end tag 
  > JSON is shorter 
  > JSON is quicker to read and write 
  > JSON can use arrays 
- the biggest difference is - XML has to be parsed with an XML parse. JSON can be parsed by a standard 
  javascript function 
  
# why JSON is better than XML 
- note > XML is much more difficult to parse than JSON 
  JSON is parsed into a ready-to-use javascript object 
- for AJAX applications, JSON is faster and easier than XML 
- using XML 
  > fetch an XML document 
  > use the XML DOM to loop through the document 
  > extract values and store in variables 
- using JSON 
  > fetch a JSON string 
  > JSON.Parse the JSON string
