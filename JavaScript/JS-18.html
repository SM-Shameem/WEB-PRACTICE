versions 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# javascript versions 
- javascript was invented by (Brendan Eich) in 1995, and became an (ECMA) standard 1997
- ECMAScript is the official name of the language 
- ECMAScript versions have been abbreviated to ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5 and ES6 
- since 2016 new versions are named by year (ECMAScript 2016/2017/2018) 

# ECMAScript Editions 
  > ES1 (ECMAScript 1 - 1997) : first edition 
  > ES2 (ECMAScript 2 - 1998) : editorial changes 
  > ES3 (ECMAScript 3 - 1999) : added regular expressions | added try/catch
  > ES4 (ECMAScript 4)        : never released 
  > ES5 (ECMAScript 5 - 2009) : added ("strict mode" | JSON support | String.trim() | Array.isArray())
                              : added (Array iteration methods)
  > ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)     : added (let & const | default parameter values | Array.find() | Array.findIndex()) 
  > ES  (ECMAScript 2016)     : added (exponential operator(**) | Array.prototype.includes)
  > ES  (ECMAScript 2017)     : added (string padding | Object.entries | Object.values | async functions)
                              : added (shared memory)
  > ES  (ECMAScript 2018)     : added (rest/spread properties | asynchronous iteration | Promise.finally())
                              : additions to RegExp

history
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# javascript / ECMAScript 
- javascript was invented by (Brendan Eich) in 1995
- it was developed for (Netscape 2), and became the (ECMA-262) standard in 1997
- after (netscape) handed javascript over to ECMA, the (mozilla) foundation continued to develop javascript for 
  the (firefox) browser 
- (mozilla's) latest version was 1.8.5 (identical to ES5) 
- Internet Explorer (IE4) was the first browser to support (ECMA-262) edition 1 (ES1) 
  *Internet Explorer 9 (IE9) did not support ES5 ("use strict")
  > 1995 :: invented by (Brendan Eich)
  > 1996 :  (Netscape 2) was released with javascript 1.0
  > 1997 :: became ECMA Standard (ECMA-262) | ECAMScript 1 (ES1) was released | IE4 was the first browser support
  > 1998 :: ECMAScript 2 was release | (Netscape 42) was released with javascript 1.3
  > 1999 :: ECMAScript 3 was released | IE5 was the first browser support 
  > 2000 :  IE5.5 was the first browser support | Netscape 62 and Firefox 1 was released with JS1.5
  > 2008 :: ECMAScript 4 was abandoned 
  > 2009 :: ECMAScript 5 was release 
  > 2011 :  IE9 was the first browser support | firefox 4 was release with JS1.8.5
  > 2012 :  full support for ES5 in safari 6, IE 10, and Chrome 23
  > 2013 :  full support for ES5 in firefox 21 and opera 15
  > 2014 :: full support for ES5 in all browsers 
  > 2015 :: ECMAScript 6 was release | full support for ES6 in firefox 52
  > 2016 :  full support for ES6 in chrome 51, opera 38, edge 14, and safari 10
  > 2018 :: full support for ES6 in all browsers 
  
# the ECMA technical committee 39 
- in 1996, Netscape and Brendan Eich took javascript to the ECMA international standards organization, 
  and a technical committee (TC39) was created to develop the language 
- ECMA-262 edition 1 was released in june 1997

# from ES4 to ES6 
- when the (TC39) committee got together in (Oslo in 2008), to agree on (ECMAScript 4), 
  they were divided into 2 different camps - 
  > the (ECMAScript 3.1) camp : Microsoft and Yahoo who wanted an incremental upgrade from (ES3) 
  > the (ECMAScript 4) camp   : Adobe, Mozilla, Opera, and Google who wanted a massive (ES4) upgrade 
- august 13 2008, (Brendan Eich) wrote an email, and the solution was to work together 
  > ECMAScript 4 was renamed to ES5 
  > ES5 should be an incremental upgrade of ECMAScript 3 
  > features of ECMAScript 4 should be picked up in later versions 
  > (TC39) sould develop a new major release, bigger in scope than ES5
- the planned new release (ES6) was code-named (Harmony), because of the split it created?

- ES5 was a huge success. it was released in 2009, and all major browsers (including IE) 
  were full compliant by 2013
  2012 (chrome 23 | IE10/edge | safari 6) | 2013 (firefox21 | opera 15) 
  
- ES6 was also a huge success. it ws released in 2015, and all major browsrs wer fully compliant by 2017 
  2017 (firefox 52) | 2016 (chrome 51 | edge 14 | safari 10 | opera 38)
